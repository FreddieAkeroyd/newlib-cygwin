    Implements subclause 7.24 of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (E).

	This is a minimal implementation for environments where
	internationalization is not considered important.

	It supports an encoding where all char codes are mapped
	to the *same* code values within a wchar_t or wint_t,
	so long as no other wchar_t codes are used by the program.
